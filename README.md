# webserver in C
A web server written in C. Serves HTML, JS, CSS, PNG, JPG, ICO files.
The server file is just the c file, which can be compiled and run with port no given in second augument.
Then the example files can be accessed via server. index.html file can be fetched through localhost:[portno] or localhost[portno]/index.html.

The server code is highly inspired by Dr. Jonas Birch video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXoWlrzb1Ok&pp=ygUPZHIuIGpvbmFzIGJpcmNo . With few more improvements done from my side.
